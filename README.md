## Summary

With nearly 20 years in software engineering, I've grown from Backend Engineer to Engineering Manager at top companies like Eventbrite, Typeform, and, more recently, Wallapop.
My journey has involved solving complex problems, building strong technical skills, and leading teams to deliver impactful projects. As the Engineering Manager for Wallapop's Payments and Checkout team, I optimize user experiences and payment processes and foster an innovative environment where engineers thrive. I'm passionate about leveraging technology and collaboration to achieve meaningful results.]
